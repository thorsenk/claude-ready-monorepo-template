# ADR-001: Use Turborepo for Monorepo Management

## Status
**Accepted** - January 2024

## Context
We need to manage a monorepo containing multiple applications (Next.js web app, NestJS API) and shared packages (UI components, utilities, types). The project requires:

- Efficient build and test pipelines
- Shared code between applications
- Independent deployment capabilities
- Good developer experience with fast builds
- CI/CD optimization with intelligent caching

We evaluated several monorepo tools:
- **Turborepo**: Modern build system with intelligent caching
- **Nx**: Feature-rich with code generation and analysis tools
- **Lerna**: Classic JavaScript monorepo tool
- **Rush**: Microsoft's scalable monorepo solution
- **pnpm workspaces only**: Minimal setup without build orchestration

## Decision
We will use **Turborepo** with **pnpm workspaces** for our monorepo management.

**Key factors in this decision:**
1. **Performance**: Intelligent caching and parallel execution
2. **Simplicity**: Minimal configuration compared to Nx
3. **Modern tooling**: Built for modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects
4. **Team familiarity**: Straightforward mental model
5. **Vercel integration**: Native support for deployment optimization

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Fast builds**: Remote caching reduces CI/CD time by 60-80%
- **Parallel execution**: Tests and builds run concurrently across packages
- **Incremental builds**: Only changed packages are rebuilt
- **Simple configuration**: Single `turbo.json` file for pipeline configuration
- **Great DX**: Fast local development with `turbo dev`
- **Deployment optimization**: Vercel automatically optimizes based on Turborepo

### Negative Consequences
- **Less mature ecosystem**: Fewer plugins compared to Nx
- **Limited analysis tools**: No built-in dependency graph visualization
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand caching strategies
- **Debugging complexity**: Caching can sometimes mask build issues

### Migration Impact
- Existing build scripts need to be refactored into Turborepo pipeline
- CI/CD configuration requires updates for remote caching
- Team needs training on Turborepo concepts and debugging

## Implementation Notes

### Project Structure
```
apps/
├── web/          # Next.js frontend
└── api/          # NestJS backend

packages/
├── ui/           # Shared React components
├── types/        # Shared TypeScript types
├── utils/        # Shared utilities
└── config/       # Shared configurations
```

### Pipeline Configuration
```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": []
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Migration Timeline
- **Week 1**: Setup Turborepo configuration and basic pipelines
- **Week 2**: Migrate build scripts and update CI/CD
- **Week 3**: Configure remote caching and optimize pipelines
- **Week 4**: Team training and documentation

### Success Metrics
- Build time reduction: Target 50% improvement
- CI/CD time reduction: Target 60% improvement
- Developer productivity: Measured by deployment frequency
- Cache hit rate: Target 80% in CI/CD
