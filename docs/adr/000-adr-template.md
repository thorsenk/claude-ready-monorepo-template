# ADR-000: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
**Template** - Use this template for all future ADRs

## Context
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a way to document significant architectural decisions, their context, and their consequences. This template provides a standard format for all ADRs in this project.

## Decision
We will use this lightweight ADR template for all architectural decisions to ensure consistency and completeness in our documentation.

## ADR Format

### Title
- **Format**: `ADR-XXX: [Short descriptive title]`
- **Number**: Sequential numbers starting from 001
- **Title**: Brief description of the decision

### Status
One of: **Proposed** | **Accepted** | **Deprecated** | **Superseded by ADR-XXX**

### Context
- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- What business or technical context is relevant?
- What are the forces at play (technical, political, social, project)?
- What constraints exist?

### Decision
- What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?
- Why is this the right decision?
- What alternatives were considered?

### Consequences
- What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced?
- What are the positive and negative consequences?
- How will this decision impact future decisions?

### Implementation Notes (Optional)
- Specific implementation details
- Migration strategy
- Timeline and milestones

### References (Optional)
- Links to related documents, discussions, or external resources
- Related ADRs
- Relevant RFCs or specifications

# ADR-001: Use React for Frontend Framework

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context
We need to choose a frontend framework for our new web application. The team has experience with multiple frameworks, and we need to balance developer productivity, performance, community support, and long-term maintenance.

## Decision
We will use React 18 with Next.js 14 for our frontend application.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Large community and ecosystem
- Strong TypeScript support
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Team expertise

**Negative:**
- Bundle size concerns
- Learning curve for junior developers
- Fast-moving ecosystem

## Implementation Notes
- Migration from prototype will take 2 weeks
- Team training scheduled for React 18 features
- Establish component library using shadcn/ui

## Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR
- Architectural patterns or frameworks
- Technology stack decisions
- Significant refactoring approaches
- Data storage and modeling decisions
- Integration patterns and external services
- Security architecture decisions
- Deployment and infrastructure choices

### When NOT to Create an ADR
- Temporary workarounds
- Bug fixes
- Minor configuration changes
- Obvious technical choices with no alternatives

### Writing Guidelines
1. **Be concise but complete** - Provide enough context for future readers
2. **Focus on the "why"** - Don't just document what, explain why
3. **Consider alternatives** - Show that you evaluated options
4. **Be honest about trade-offs** - Document negative consequences too
5. **Update when needed** - Mark as deprecated/superseded when appropriate

### Review Process
1. Create ADR as a draft (Status: Proposed)
2. Share with team for review and discussion
3. Address feedback and iterate
4. Mark as Accepted when consensus is reached
5. Update related documentation

### Naming Convention
- **Files**: `NNN-short-title.md` (e.g., `001-use-react.md`)
- **Numbers**: Zero-padded, sequential (001, 002, 003...)
- **Titles**: Lowercase with hyphens, descriptive but concise
